Source code produces numerous solutions or called "experiments" to fit users request for finite impulse response (FIR) function.
According different constraints such as limited hardware or critical timing, users can pick one of them to feed their needs.
Some of solutions might not have overall performance enhancement actually or just incomplete and imperfect solution. 
Source code tries to produce all probable choices, and analysis and comparison is a must.
I pick one of solutions which concerning limited hardware and expect decent performance on it in my code_opt.
